Kayak.com is a free online service which allows users to search for flights and hotels.
The Bonita connectors included in this project retrieve flight and hotel details from Kayak.com, and make 
them available to the Bonita process developer as an XML document. Note that the Kayak.com 
connectors were tested with BOS-5.3.1.

UPDATE: Kayak.com is no longer providing the API required for retrieving travel information from their site.
Consequently, our Kayak.com connectors are unable to collect available flight and hotel information. This 
project is only for illustration purposes.
